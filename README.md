### Building and running the application

First configure a `.env` file based on the example shown in [.env.example](/.env.example)

When you're ready, start the application by running:
`docker compose up --build`

or in development you can use the watch attribute to automatically watch for and sync file
changes into they running docker container to make testing changes easier:

`docker compose up --build --watch`.


The application will be available at http://localhost:8000.

If you have any issue you can try to run the DB migrations:
`docker compose run django-web python manage.py migrate`
